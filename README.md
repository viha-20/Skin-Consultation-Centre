# Skin-Consultation-Centre

2022 - Course Work Skin Consultation Centre

A program that implements a system to manage a Skin Consultation Centre.

    A console system from where the manager can add new doctors, delete if needed, add or cancel consultations, print and save them.

GUI - Used Java Swing

• The user can visualise the list of doctors with relative information. The user should be able to sort the list alphabetically. You are suggested to use a table to display this information on the GUI but you can choose any other solution.

• The user can select a doctor and add a consultation with that specific doctor. When implementing these functionalities, you need to comply with the following requirements:

* The user can check the availability of the doctor in specific date/time and can book a consultation for a patient if the doctor is available. If the doctor is not available automatically another doctor will be allocated, who is available in that specific date/time. The choice of the doctor has to be done randomly among all available doctors

For each consultation the user has to:

* Add patient information (add all the attributes defined above - name, surname, date of birth, mobile number, id).

* Enter and save the cost for the consultation. Consider that each consultation is £25 per hour and the first consultation is £15 per hour.

* Add some notes (this could be textual information or the user could upload some images of the skin). This information should be encrypted in order to preserver data privacy (6 marks). You can use available APIs for the encryption of data.

* Once the consultation has been saved in the system, the user can select it and visualise all the stored information.
